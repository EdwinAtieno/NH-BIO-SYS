# NAIROBI BIOMEDICAL SYSTEMS PANEL
Biomedical equipment refers to the technical devices and instruments used in the healthcare industry to diagnose, monitor, and treat patients. This equipment includes a wide range of devices, such as imaging machines (MRI, CT scanners, X-ray machines), surgical equipment (lasers, endoscopes), diagnostic equipment (blood analyzers, electrocardiographs), and therapeutic devices (ventilators, dialysis machines). Biomedical equipment systems typically include not only the equipment itself, but also the supporting infrastructure, such as power supplies, communication networks, and computer systems, that are necessary to operate the equipment. These systems play a crucial role in modern healthcare, providing doctors and other medical professionals with the tools they need to accurately diagnose and effectively treat patients.
