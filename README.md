# RIZIKI ADMIN PANEL

RIZIKI is a Swahili word meaning ‘daily earnings’

We are a B2B Kenyan foodtech start up focused on the cereals. The products in this vertical include cereals, grains, lentils, pulses, flour, spices, and herbs.

Riziki seeks to address the problem of food insecurity and unemployment among the potentially productive populace.
Enabling such critical cereals & grains accessing markets daily, and unemployed folk in town-centres finding a reliable-
variety driven supplier, we begin our contribution in alleviating these positions for Kenya and Africa as a whole.
